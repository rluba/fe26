# Fe26: Jai port of (parts of) iron

This repository contains a Jai port of parts of [Hapi’s `iron`](https://github.com/hapijs/iron) cryptography library.

It’s by no means complete and currently only contains the `unseal` part of the algorithm and only its default ciphers,
some of which shouldn’t be used for new projects anymore.
